EXAMPLE OUTPUT FOR FUNCTIONALITY SECTION:

Home Page Interface:

[Image: Homepage displaying movie cards in a grid layout with movie posters, titles, director names, ratings, and review counts, with BLOCK BUSTER logo at the top]

Upon opening the Movie Review Platform, users are greeted with a modern and visually appealing homepage that displays the movie catalog. At the top of the page, the "BLOCK BUSTER" label functions as a logo, representing the identity of the platform, and is accompanied by navigation buttons for logging in or signing up.

The main page displays movie cards in an attractive grid layout, each showing the movie poster image, movie title, director name, release year, average rating displayed as stars out of 10, number of reviews, and an "Add Review" button. Users can click anywhere on a movie card to view detailed information about that movie, creating an intuitive browsing experience that encourages exploration.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT FOR API SECTION:

User Registration (Sign Up):

[Image: Swagger UI showing the POST /users endpoint with request body containing username, email, and password fields]

This endpoint validates the user registration functionality through a POST request to the /users endpoint, demonstrating the API's ability to create new user accounts in the system. The endpoint uses the POST method at the URL http://localhost:3001/users, requires no authentication, and returns a 201 Created status code when successful.

When a user fills out the sign-up form and clicks "SIGN UP", the frontend sends this request to create a new account in the database. The request includes the username, email, and password in JSON format, and the system validates that the username is unique and all fields meet the requirements. Upon successful creation, the endpoint returns the newly created user account information.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT FOR SETUP SECTION:

Prerequisites:

[Image: Terminal/command prompt window showing Node.js version check command and version number display]

Before beginning the setup process, you need to have Node.js version 16 or higher installed on your computer. Node.js is a program that allows you to run JavaScript applications, and you can download it from nodejs.org. Additionally, npm (Node Package Manager) comes automatically with Node.js and is a tool that downloads and installs all the code libraries the application needs to work.

To check if you have Node.js installed, open a terminal or command prompt window (on Windows search for "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell", on Mac or Linux search for "Terminal"), then type "node --version" and press Enter. If you see a version number like v18.0.0, you have Node.js installed. If you see an error message, you need to download and install Node.js from nodejs.org before proceeding with the setup.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT FOR TROUBLESHOOTING SECTION:

Problem: "Loading movies..." Message Stuck on Screen:

[Image: Browser showing the loading screen with error messages visible in the developer console]

This problem occurs when the frontend is trying to load movies from the backend, but it's not receiving a response. The "Loading movies..." message appears because the application is waiting for data that never arrives, typically indicating that the backend server is not running or cannot be reached.

To solve this issue, first check if the backend is running by looking at your backend terminal window for the message "Application is running on: http://localhost:3001". If you don't see this message, the backend isn't running and you need to start it by navigating to the backend directory in your terminal and typing "npm run start:dev", then waiting for the startup messages to appear. You can also verify the backend is working by opening your web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3001/api, where you should see the Swagger API documentation page. If this page doesn't load, the backend has a problem that needs to be addressed.
