EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT:

Home Page Interface:

[Image: Homepage showing movie cards in a grid layout with movie posters, titles, director names, ratings, and review counts, with BLOCK BUSTER logo at the top]

Upon opening the Movie Review Platform, users are greeted with a modern and visually appealing homepage that displays the movie catalog. At the top of the page, the "BLOCK BUSTER" label functions as a logo, representing the identity of the platform, and is accompanied by navigation buttons for logging in or signing up.

The main page displays movie cards in an attractive grid layout, each showing the movie poster image, movie title, director name, release year, average rating displayed as stars out of 10, number of reviews, and an "Add Review" button. Users can click anywhere on a movie card to view detailed information about that movie, creating an intuitive browsing experience that encourages exploration.

Sign-Up Functionality:

[Image: Sign-up form modal displaying input fields for username, email, password, and re-type password with validation messages visible]

This feature allows new users to create an account and join the Movie Review Platform community. The sign-up form appears in a clean, centered pop-up window (modal) that overlays the main page, providing a focused registration experience. The form includes four input fields: username, which must be at least 3 characters long and unique to the platform; email address, requiring a valid email format; password, with a minimum of 6 characters for security; and a re-type password field to confirm the password was entered correctly.

The form includes validation to ensure all information meets requirements, and if a username already exists, the system will notify the user to choose a different one. Once all fields are filled correctly, clicking the "SIGN UP" button creates a new user account and automatically logs the user into the platform. At the bottom of the form, there's an "Already have an account? LOG IN" link, allowing existing users to quickly switch to the login form.
